# NumPy

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Designed for performance, NumPy allows for efficient numerical computations and is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and scientific research.

## Features
- Powerful N-dimensional array object
- Broadcasting functions
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- Useful linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities

## Installation
Install NumPy via pip:
```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a)
```
